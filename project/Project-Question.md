# PROJECT QUESTION #

**What is the question you hope to answer?**
Do seniors who eat more fruit on a daily basis have lesser chances of having a heart disease?

**What data are you planning to use to answer that question?**
I am planning to use [2015 BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2015.html) survey data. 
This data is collected over phone every year by Department of Health. This data is cross-sectional.


**What do you know about the data so far?**
In 2015, 441,456 people from all 50 states were interviewed about their health-related behaviors and chronic conditions. The interviewees answered over 120 mandatory and optional questions re their activities and chronic conditions.
The resultant data set has responses to all the questions from the questionnaire along with calculated variables which are made available for analysis.
The data set can be downloaded either as a fixed width text file or a sas export file. I will be using later and loading it into Python using Pandas ```read_sas()``` function.

**Why did you choose this topic?**
I work for a Medicare company that provides quality healthcare to seniors. 
It is our continuous effort to identify risky behaviors and address them early on to prevent chronic diseases. 
Additionally I found out that there has been some research on this topic in past years (see references) - and that's good because there is some scientific basis for my project. 
But I also feel that I can find a better explanation or relation between fruit intake and heart disease using BRFSS data.
